## Work Experience 💼

My experience lies at the intersection of IT and quality management in the food production industry (yeast and food concentrate), where I have been involved in data analysis, creating dashboards using Power BI, and building my first predictive models.

### Achievments 🏆

1. Established a robust packaging material testing system utilizing statistical tools such as regression analysis, correlation analysis, and Student's t-test. This minimized risks associated with new packaging introductions.
2. Implemented a Customer Satisfaction Index (CSI) and revamped the complaint handling process by leveraging CRM and Power BI. This integrated data from four plants into a unified system, digitized customer satisfaction measurement, and reduced recurring systemic issues.
3. Spearheaded the development and successful implementation of  management systems (ISO 22000:2018, FAMI-QS v6, Halal, Kosher), unlocking access to new markets including China, Turkey, Algeria, Uganda, and Ethiopia, while significantly enhancing the company's reputation.
4. Successfully implemented pathogen management systems across three production facilities, including enhanced microbiological risk management and expanded analysis protocols. This resulted in a 23% reduction in potential contamination sources, bolstering both food safety and production hygiene standards.
